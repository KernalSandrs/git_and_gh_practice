One of my favorite trips was my first missions trip to Haiti. I had never been
out of the country before, and my first time doing so was a trip that wasn't
about me at all. But on that trip, I met the woman who is now my wife. I went
with selfless intention, and I was rewarded with marrying the woman of my
dreams, and I couldn't be happier.
